# VCD4j usage examples
Files in this the [examples](src/examples/examples/) directory demonstrate basic usage examples of the library.  

## [VCDParserExample](examples/VCDParserExample.java)
`VCDParser` is used to read and parse VCD data from `.vcd` files.

## [VCDWriterExample](examples/VCDWriterExample.java)
`VCDWriter`'s purpose is to write a `VCD` object to a file or an output stream.

A file generated by the example code.  

## [VCDPlayerExample](examples/VCDParserExample.java)
`VCDPlayer` takes a `VCD` object (constructed manually or parsed with `VCDParser`) and plays it in real time.  

## [VCDRecorderExample](examples/VCDRecorderExample.java)
`VCDRecorder` records signals (both binary and multi-bit) from arbitrary sources and stores them in a `VCD` object that can then be replayed or saved to file.
